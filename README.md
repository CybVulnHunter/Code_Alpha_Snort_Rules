# **üõ°Ô∏è SNORT: Intrusion Detection System üõ°Ô∏è**

## Protecting Networks with Custom Rules and Real-Time Alerts

---

## **Introduction**

With the increasing connectivity of networks, securing sensitive data has become more critical than ever. **Snort**, an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), plays a pivotal role in network security by monitoring traffic, detecting suspicious activity, and generating alerts based on predefined rules.

This project demonstrates **Snort's** capabilities in enhancing network security through its installation, configuration, and the creation of custom detection rules.

## **Objective**

This project provides hands-on experience in:
- Installing **Snort** on Ubuntu Linux.
- Configuring the `snort.conf` file to tailor monitoring parameters.
- Writing custom **Snort rules** for detecting specific traffic patterns, including:
  - ICMP (ping) packets.
  - HTTPS traffic to specific URLs.
- Testing and analyzing alerts generated by Snort.

By the end of this lab, users will have a clear understanding of **Snort's** role in active network monitoring and defense.
